# creditcard_fraud-on-imblanced-dataset
This repository contains code and resources for implementing a credit card fraud detection model on an imbalanced dataset.
The goal is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions accurately, despite the inherent class imbalance in the dataset.


Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals. Traditional fraud detection methods often 
struggle to cope with the increasing sophistication of fraudulent activities. Machine learning models can provide a more effective 
solution by automatically learning patterns indicative of fraud. However, credit card fraud datasets are highly imbalanced, with a 
small number of fraud cases compared to legitimate transactions. This poses a challenge for developing accurate models, as they can 
become biased towards the majority class. This repository addresses this issue by presenting a methodologies like undersampling and oversampling 
to train a fraud detection model on imbalanced data.
